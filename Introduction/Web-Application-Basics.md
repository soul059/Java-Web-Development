# Web Application Basics

A web application, or web app, is a software program that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser. Unlike a traditional desktop application, you don't need to download and install it on your computer.

### Key Differences: Web App vs. Website

While the terms are often used interchangeably, there's a key distinction:

*   **Website:** Primarily informational, providing static content to users. Think of a digital brochure or a blog.
*   **Web Application:** Interactive and dynamic, allowing users to perform tasks, manipulate data, and engage with features in real-time. Examples include online banking, social media platforms, and e-commerce sites.

### How Web Apps Work: The Client-Server Model

Web applications operate on a client-server model, which means the code is divided into two parts:

*   **Client-Side (Frontend):** This is what you see and interact with in your browser. It's built using technologies like HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
*   **Server-Side (Backend):** This is the engine of the application. It handles data processing, business logic, and communication with the database. Common backend languages include Python, Java, Ruby, and PHP.

When you use a web app, your browser (the client) sends a request to the web server. The server processes the request, interacts with the database if necessary, and sends a response back to your browser, which then displays the information on your screen.

### Core Components of Web Application Architecture

A typical web application architecture is multi-layered:

*   **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** This is the user interface that you interact with.
*   **Application/Business Layer (Backend):** This layer contains the core business logic and processes user requests.
*   **Data Layer:** This includes the database and the database management system, responsible for storing and retrieving data.

### Common Technologies and Frameworks

A wide range of technologies are used to build web applications:

*   **Frontend Frameworks:** Tools like React, Angular, and Vue.js help developers build dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
*   **Backend Frameworks:** Frameworks such as Django (Python), Ruby on Rails (Ruby), Express.js (Node.js), and Laravel (PHP) simplify backend development.
*   **Databases:** SQL databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB are used for data storage and management.
