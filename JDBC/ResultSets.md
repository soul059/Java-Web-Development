# JDBC ResultSets

In Java, a `ResultSet` is an interface in the `java.sql` package that represents the table of data generated by executing a database query. When you execute a SQL query using JDBC, the results are returned in a `ResultSet` object. This object maintains a cursor that points to the current row of data.

### Key Characteristics of a `ResultSet`:

*   **Cursor:** A `ResultSet` object has a cursor that initially points before the first row of the result set. You can use the `next()` method to move the cursor to the next row. This method returns `false` when there are no more rows to process, making it suitable for use in a `while` loop to iterate through the results.
*   **Data Retrieval:** You can retrieve data from the current row using various `get` methods, such as `getInt()`, `getString()`, `getDouble()`, and `getDate()`. These methods have two variations: one that accepts a column index (starting from 1) and another that accepts the column name.
*   **Types of `ResultSet`:**
    *   **`TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY`**: This is the default type. The cursor can only move forward from the first row to the last.
    *   **`TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE`**: The cursor can move forward and backward, but it is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database.
    *   **`TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE`**: The cursor can move forward and backward, and it is sensitive to changes made by others to the database.
*   **Concurrency:** `ResultSet` objects can also have different concurrency levels:
    *   **`CONCUR_READ_ONLY`**: This is the default. You can only read the data in the result set.
    *   **`CONCUR_UPDATABLE`**: You can update the data in the result set and have those changes reflected in the database.

### How to Use a `ResultSet`:

Here is a basic example of how to use a `ResultSet`:

```java
import java.sql.*;

public class ResultSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
        String user = "your_username";
        String password = "your_password";

        try (Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
             Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
             ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery("SELECT id, name, email FROM users")) {

            while (resultSet.next()) {
                int id = resultSet.getInt("id");
                String name = resultSet.getString("name");
                String email = resultSet.getString("email");

                System.out.println("ID: " + id + ", Name: " + name + ", Email: " + email);
            }
        } catch (SQLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example:

1.  A `Connection` to the database is established.
2.  A `Statement` object is created.
3.  The `executeQuery()` method is called on the `Statement` object, which returns a `ResultSet`.
4.  The `while (resultSet.next())` loop iterates through each row of the `ResultSet`.
5.  Inside the loop, `getInt()` and `getString()` are used to retrieve the data from each column.
6.  The resources (`Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet`) are automatically closed by the try-with-resources statement.

### Navigational Methods:

For scrollable `ResultSet` objects, you can use the following methods to navigate through the rows:

*   `previous()`: Moves the cursor to the previous row.
*   `first()`: Moves the cursor to the first row.
*   `last()`: Moves the cursor to the last row.
*   `beforeFirst()`: Moves the cursor to the position before the first row.
*   `afterLast()`: Moves the cursor to the position after the last row.
*   `absolute(int row)`: Moves the cursor to the specified row number.
*   `relative(int rows)`: Moves the cursor a relative number of rows, either positive or negative.
